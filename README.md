## GeoMX introduction.
GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) from NanoString is a state-of-the-art platform designed to address the complexities of tissue heterogeneity and the microenvironment in spatial biology. This technology is particularly advantageous for its biology-driven profiling, allowing researchers to select and analyze regions of interest with unprecedented precision and sensitivity. It uniquely enables non-destructive RNA and protein profiling from specific tissue compartments and cell populations, leveraging automated and scalable workflows compatible with FFPE and fresh frozen sections. GeoMx DSP supports various applications, from biomarker discovery to elucidating disease mechanisms and drug actions, by spatially profiling the whole transcriptome and over 570 proteins from intact tissue. It integrates with standard histology staining procedures, ensuring seamless adoption into existing research protocols.
